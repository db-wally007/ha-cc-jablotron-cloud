# Section bypass constants
# Control errors meaning "devices in this section are active and must be bypassed to arm".

# detectors, so a bypass can never be attributed to the door or window that caused it.

# A bypass is only ever reported in the reply to a control request, so the sensor is a short
# pulse meant to drive a notification or a pop-up rather than a lasting state.

# Network timeout applied to every Jablotron Cloud request. jablotronpy calls requests.post()

# would otherwise hold the lock and freeze both polling and commands indefinitely.
